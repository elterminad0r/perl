# perl
Has nothing to do with Perl. Rather, with George Perlin and Perlin noise. A couple of small pieces of code exploring the applications of Perlin noise in various dimensions. Here are some screenshots:

Dual 1-dimensional Perlin noise to move a point through 2-d space, with time as input (not very inspiring, I know):

2-dimensional Perlin noise to generate a moving, smooth curve (with added rainbows). Varies with x and time.

3-dimensional Perlin noise to generate a smooth, moving, heatmap type thing. Varies with x, y, and time

There is also [a video](https://youtu.be/gF6Wr106b4M) of this one.

Lots of Perlin noise to move a box through 3-D space a la Wingardium Leviosa. Varies a lot.
